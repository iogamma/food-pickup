        Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: I thought we were sparring. Commander William Adama: That's why you don't win. Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: [in a deleted scene after Laura Roslin asked him if what she did was a mistake] I believe that it is never a mistake to follow your heart. Ellen Tigh: So, you worried about Wallace Grey? I hear he's ahead in the vote count. Tom Zarek: Whatever the people want is fine by me. Ellen Tigh: Everyone has an agenda. I know I do. Tom Zarek: And what would that be? Ellen Tigh: Same as yours, Tom. Me, myself, and... ooh. I. Tom Zarek: You are... clearly a well-connected, well-informed woman. Ellen Tigh: Wife of the XO, for whatever that's worth. Tom Zarek: Ah. Quite a bit. Now, and in the future. Ellen Tigh: That's what I'm interested in, Tom. It's my place, and my... husband's place in the future. Tom Zarek: Okay. I'm looking for a friend of mine. His name is Valence. [scene immediately cuts to Valence dead in his cell in the brig with his wrists cut] Doctor Gaius Baltar: You'll forgive me, Madam President, if I don't wish to be executed based solely on your... gut feeling.
